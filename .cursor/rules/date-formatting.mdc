# Date Formatting Standards

This rule ensures consistent date formatting across all code, documentation, and AI-generated content.

## CRITICAL: Always Use Accurate Dates

**NEVER guess or randomly generate dates.** All dates must be 100% accurate and reflect the actual system date. Always determine the current date dynamically from:

1. **System clock** (preferred for most cases)
2. **MCP services** (when available and appropriate)
3. **Environment variables** (for testing or specific scenarios)

**Key Principles**: 
- **Created dates**: Should reflect the actual system date when the file was created (for audit history)
- **Updated dates**: Should reflect the actual current system date when the file was last modified
- **Never guess dates**: Always use the actual system date, never random or outdated values

## Required Date Format

**All dates MUST be in ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DD`**

Examples:

- ✅ `2025-01-19` (correct)
- ❌ `2025-1-19` (missing leading zero)
- ❌ `19-01-2025` (wrong order)
- ❌ `January 19, 2025` (not ISO format)
- ❌ `2025/01/19` (wrong separator)

## Implementation Guidelines

### Python Code

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Get current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
current_date = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

# For file headers, docstrings, etc.
def get_current_date() -> str:
    """Get current date in YYYY-MM-DD format."""
    return datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
```

### Documentation

```markdown
<!-- In markdown files -->

Date: 2025-01-19

<!-- Or use dynamic generation when possible -->

Last Updated: {{ current_date }}
```

### File Headers

```python
"""
Module description here.

Author: AI Assistant
Date: 2025-01-19  # Must be current date, not hardcoded
"""
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. File Headers and Docstrings

```python
"""
Work Sessions Merger for WBSO Hours Registration

Author: AI Assistant
Created: 2025-01-19  # Actual system date when file was created
Updated: 2025-01-19  # Current system date when last modified
"""
```

### 2. Logging and Timestamps

```python
import logging
from datetime import datetime

# Use ISO format for log timestamps
logging.basicConfig(
    format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s",
    datefmt="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
)
```

### 3. Data Processing

```python
# When processing date-sensitive data
def process_data_with_date():
    current_date = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
    # Use current_date in processing logic
```

### 4. Configuration Files

```python
# In configuration or metadata
config = {
    "created_date": datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),  # When config was created
    "updated_date": datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),  # When config was last updated
    "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### 5. Project Documentation (TASK-*.md, STORY-*.md)

```markdown
# TASK-034: Synthetic Work Session Generation

Created: 2025-01-19  # Actual system date when task was created
Updated: 2025-01-19  # Current system date when task was last modified

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Tests written
```

## AI Assistant Behavior

When AI assistants generate code or documentation:

1. **Use current date for Create: or Update: fields** - never guess dates
2. **Use system clock** to determine current date
3. **Format as YYYY-MM-DD** consistently
4. **Update existing hardcoded dates** when modifying files
5. **Do not update existing Create: dates** when modifying files
6. **Include date generation logic** in code when appropriate

## Error Prevention

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Guessing dates**: `Created: 2025-01-15` when it's actually 2025-10-19 ❌
2. **Wrong format**: `Date: 1/15/2025` ❌
3. **Missing leading zeros**: `Date: 2025-1-5` ❌
4. **Inconsistent separators**: `Date: 2025.01.15` ❌
5. **Updating existing Created dates**: `Created: 2025-10-19` when there was a previous value of 2025-06-01 ❌
6. **Not using actual system date for new files**: `Created: 2025-01-15` for a new file when system date is 2025-10-19 ❌
7. **Outdated Updated dates**: `Updated: 2025-01-15` when file was actually modified on 2025-10-19 ❌

### Validation

Before writing code and documentation:

- Determine the actual system clock date
- Convert to YYYY-MM-DD format and maintain in memory
- Use for Updated: fields and new Created: fields
- Preserve existing Created: dates for audit history

Before committing code:

- Check for hardcoded dates
- Verify date format is YYYY-MM-DD
- Ensure dates are current (not future or past dates unless intentional)

## Integration with Other Rules

This rule works with:

- [golden-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/golden-rules.mdc) - Core development principles
- [coding-style.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/coding-style.mdc) - Code formatting standards
- [documentation-code-sync.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/documentation-code-sync.mdc) - Documentation standards

## Examples

### Good Examples

```python
# Dynamic date generation
current_date = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

# File header with accurate dates
"""
Script: data_processor.py
Author: AI Assistant
Created: 2025-01-19  # Actual system date when created
Updated: 2025-10-19  # Current system date when last modified
"""

# Configuration with accurate dates
config = {
    "created": datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),  # When config was created
    "updated": datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),  # When config was last updated
    "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### Bad Examples

```python
# Guessed date (WRONG)
"""
Script: data_processor.py
Author: AI Assistant
Created: 2025-01-15  # Random guess instead of actual system date
"""

# Wrong format (WRONG)
current_date = "1/15/2025"  # Should be "2025-01-15"

# Missing leading zero (WRONG)
current_date = "2025-1-5"  # Should be "2025-01-05"

# Updating existing Created date (WRONG)
# Original: Created: 2025-06-01
# Modified: Created: 2025-10-19  # Should preserve original Created date
```

## Enforcement

This rule is enforced by:

- AI assistant behavior (always apply)
- Code review processes
- Pre-commit hooks (when applicable)
- Documentation standards

Remember: **Accurate dates, accurate dates, accurate dates!** Never guess or randomly generate dates. All dates must be 100% accurate and reflect the actual system date. Preserve Created dates for audit history, update Updated dates with current system date.
