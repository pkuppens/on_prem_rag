# Feedback Integration Rule

## Purpose
This rule enables continuous improvement of the development workflow through structured feedback and retrospectives.

## How to Provide Feedback

Use `@feedback-integration:` followed by your feedback message. The feedback can be positive, negative, or mixed:

### Examples
```
@feedback-integration: This last session was very successful! The task breakdown worked well and the code quality was excellent.
```

```
@feedback-integration: The typical task size was still a bit large, it took many iterations and a complex pull request over many components to complete the issue.
```

```
@feedback-integration: The automated testing worked great this time, but the documentation updates were forgotten again. Also, the PR review process was smoother than usual.
```

## AI Response to Feedback

When you receive feedback with `@feedback-integration:`:

1. **Analyze the feedback** - Identify what worked well, what didn't work, and mixed signals
2. **Categorize improvements needed** - Determine which processes or documentation need updates
3. **Update relevant documentation** in this priority order:
   - [codex rules](mdc:../agents/codex_rules.md) - For agent-specific workflow and task management improvements
   - Cursor rules in `.cursor/rules/` - For development process improvements  
   - [ARCHITECTURE.md](mdc:ARCHITECTURE.md) - For technical approach and constraint improvements
4. **Apply improvements** - Implement the enhanced process for current and future work
5. **Acknowledge the feedback** with a summary of changes made

### Handling Mixed Feedback
For feedback containing both positive and negative elements:
- **Extract successful patterns** from positive aspects and reinforce them in documentation
- **Identify root causes** for negative aspects and implement fixes
- **Balance improvements** - ensure fixes don't eliminate successful practices

## Documentation Update Guidelines

### When updating [codex rules](mdc:../agents/codex_rules.md):
- Add new guidelines to relevant sections
- Update workflow steps based on lessons learned
- Refine task sizing and management practices
- Enhance quality gates and standards

### When updating cursor rules:
- Create new rules for recurring patterns
- Modify existing rules to address identified issues
- Ensure rules are actionable and specific

### When updating [ARCHITECTURE.md](mdc:ARCHITECTURE.md):
- Document technical constraints discovered
- Add new patterns or anti-patterns
- Update decision records based on outcomes

## Examples of Improvements

### Task Sizing Issues
If feedback indicates tasks are too large:
- Update [codex rules](mdc:../agents/codex_rules.md) with smaller task breakdown guidelines
- Create cursor rule for task complexity assessment
- Document maximum task scope in hours/story points

### Code Quality Issues  
If feedback indicates quality problems:
- Enhance testing requirements in [codex rules](mdc:../agents/codex_rules.md)
- Update code review standards
- Add quality gate cursor rules

### Documentation Issues
If feedback indicates documentation gaps:
- Strengthen documentation requirements in [codex rules](mdc:../agents/codex_rules.md)
- Create cursor rules for documentation timing
- Update documentation hierarchy guidance

## Feedback Integration Workflow

1. **Receive feedback** using `@feedback-integration:` format
2. **Analyze and categorize** the feedback content and impact areas
3. **Identify specific improvements** needed in processes or documentation  
4. **Update relevant files** following the priority order above
5. **Confirm changes** with a summary of improvements made
6. **Apply improvements** to current and future work

This rule ensures that every piece of feedback leads to concrete improvements in our development workflow and documentation.
