# Sprint Demos

## Purpose

This directory contains sprint demo planning and documentation as part of our SAFe implementation. While demos are typically part of sprint reviews, we maintain structured demo documentation here to:

1. **Support Sprint Reviews**: Provide clear demonstration scripts and success criteria
2. **Enable Stakeholder Alignment**: Document features and capabilities for stakeholder review
3. **Track Progress**: Map demonstrated features to stories and program increments
4. **Maintain History**: Keep record of demonstrated capabilities for reference

## Structure

- `current/` - Current sprint demo planning
- `archive/` - Historical demo documentation
- `templates/` - Demo documentation templates

## Integration with SAFe

- Demos align with Sprint Reviews in the SAFe framework
- Each demo maps to completed stories in the current sprint
- Demo documentation supports the Program Increment (PI) System Demo
- Success criteria tie back to story acceptance criteria

## Usage

1. Use templates for new demo documentation
2. Update current demo during sprint execution
3. Move to archive after successful demonstration
4. Link demos to relevant stories and features
