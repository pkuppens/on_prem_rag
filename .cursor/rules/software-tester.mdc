## Retrospective Feedback

### Learning and Improvement

When tasks cannot be completed on the first try, document lessons learned:

```bash
# Create retrospective note (concatenate to allow multiple entries)
echo "STORY-XXX Software Tester Retrospective:
- Issue: [What went wrong or was unclear]
- Root Cause: [Why it happened]
- Solution: [What worked or should be done differently]
- Recommendation: [Specific improvement for own or other roles]
- Date: $(date)" >> tmp/retrospectives/software-tester-retrospectives.md
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Testing Complexity**: Break down complex test scenarios into smaller, manageable test cases
- **Test Data Issues**: Better test data management and isolation
- **Environment Problems**: Improve test environment setup and configuration
- **Integration Testing**: Better coordination with development team for integration testing

## Commit and Continue Workflow

### Staging vs Committing

All role changes are staged for review rather than committed directly:

```bash
# Stage changes for review
git add tests/test_STORY-XXX_*.py
git add project/team/tests/STORY-XXX-*.md
git add project/team/stories/STORY-XXX.md

# Note: Changes are staged for review. Use "commit and continue" to commit and proceed.
```

### Commit and Continue Command

When the user says "commit and continue", execute:

```bash
# Create commit message file for review
echo "STORY-XXX: Software Tester: [description of changes]" > tmp/commit_msg.txt

# Create continuation context file
echo "Next Steps:
1. [Specific next action]
2. [Dependencies to check]
3. [Handover requirements]
4. [Timeline considerations]" > tmp/continuation.txt

# Commit staged changes using message file
git commit -F tmp/commit_msg.txt

# Continue with next steps in the workflow
```

This allows the user to review both the commit message and continuation context before proceeding.

## Handover Messages

### For Next Role (Product Owner)

```
"STORY-XXX testing is complete. Quality assessment: [Pass/Fail/Conditional],
[X] bugs found and resolved, demo readiness: [Ready/Not Ready].
Please review quality assessment and approve for demo."
```

### For User Review

```
"STORY-XXX testing completed. All acceptance criteria validated,
quality assessment documented, and demo readiness confirmed.
Ready for Product Owner handover. Changes are staged for review.
Use 'commit and continue' to commit and proceed. Please review test results and approve quality."
```

This rule ensures Software Testers can effectively plan, execute, and manage testing activities, providing comprehensive quality assurance and clear handover to Product Owners with proper git-based documentation and quality tracking throughout the testing process.
