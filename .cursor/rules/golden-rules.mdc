# Golden Rules for AI Coding Assistance

For consolidated guidance see [agents/README.md](mdc:../../agents/README.md).
This guide outlines the key principles and practices for AI-assisted development in our SAFe environment.

## Core Principles

1. **File Size Management**
   - Keep files under 500 lines of code
   - Split into modules when approaching limit
   - Maintain clear module boundaries

2. **Conversation Management**
   - Start fresh conversations frequently
   - One task per message for optimal results
   - Avoid long-running threads that degrade quality

3. **Documentation First**
   - Follow documentation hierarchy for updates:
     1. Update working files (.gitignored)
     2. Update task-level documentation
     3. Update story/feature documentation
     4. Update epic-level documentation if needed
     5. Update architectural decisions in ARCHITECTURE.md
     6. Keep README.md current for project-wide changes
   - Write code comments alongside implementation
   - Never delay documentation updates
   - Document discovered tasks in CURRENT_WORK.md

4. **Coding Style**
   - Follow [coding-style.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/coding-style.mdc) guidelines
   - **Function Design**: Follow [function-definitions.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/function-definitions.mdc) for comprehensive function standards
   - Use dedicated functions for file operations
   - Keep progress tracking separate from core logic

## Project Structure

### Documentation Hierarchy

#### Version Controlled Documentation
- `EPIC-*.md` - Strategic initiatives and business objectives
- `FEATURE-*.md` - Feature scope, constraints, and acceptance criteria
- `STORY-*.md` - User stories with acceptance criteria and implementation notes
- `TASK-*.md` - Technical implementation details and completion criteria
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture, technical decisions, and constraints
- `README.md` - Project overview, setup, and maintenance guidelines

#### Working Documentation (.gitignored)
- `CURRENT_WORK.md` - Active tasks, notes, and immediate TODOs
- `NEXT_DEMO.md` - Features and changes for upcoming demonstration
- `SCRATCH.md` - Temporary notes and experimental ideas

### Code Organization
- `src/` - Source code with clear component separation
- `tests/` - Test files mirroring source structure
- `docs/` - Technical and API documentation
- `.cursor/rules/` - AI assistance rules and guidelines

## Development Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase
- Review ARCHITECTURE.md at start of new conversations
- Check TASK.md before starting new work
- Update task tracking during development
- Document discovered sub-tasks

### 2. Implementation Phase
- One task per conversation
- Use test driven development to develop new features
- Write pytest unit tests for the edge cases of each new feature
- Include docstrings and comments in both code and tests for interfaces like function calls, and complex code segments
- Follow coding style guidelines
- Use SOLID principles where applicable, like dependency injection for external interfaces.

### 3. Testing Standards
- Create tests for every new feature
- Test structure:
  - 1 test for expected use
  - edge case tests
  - failure case test for proper error handling
- Mock external service calls
- Update tests when logic changes

## Coding Standards

### General Principles
1. **Readability First**
   - Use clear, descriptive names
   - Follow language-preference rule for code comments
   - Document complex logic with inline comments

2. **Documentation Integration**
   - Link code changes to stories/tasks using IDs
   - Update documentation alongside code changes
   - Add "Reason:" comments for complex logic
   - Follow documentation hierarchy for updates

3. **Quality Gates**
   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Follow TDD where applicable
   - Ensure code coverage meets standards
   - Address technical debt proactively

### Security and Environment
1. **Environment Management**
   - Never trust AI with API keys
   - Implement environment variables manually
   - Use secure configuration patterns
   - Document all required variables

2. **Security Best Practices**
   - Never expose sensitive data
   - Use environment variables for configuration
   - Follow security best practices
   - Document security considerations

3. **Dependency Management**
   - **CRITICAL: Always use `uv add` for project dependencies - NEVER use `pip install`**
   - `pip install` only works locally and causes failures in fresh environments
   - All imported packages must exist in `pyproject.toml` dependencies
   - Before importing: check if package exists, add with `uv add`, then import
   - Use `uv sync` for installing dependencies in fresh environments

## Communication Standards

1. **Code Comments**
   - Follow language-preference rule for English usage
   - Explain complex logic
   - Document assumptions
   - Document decisions
   - Include examples for unclear code

2. **Documentation**
   - Follow markdown standards
   - Keep README files updated
   - Document breaking changes
   - Include setup instructions

## AI Interaction Guidelines

1. **Request Clarity**
   - Be specific in requests
   - Provide relevant examples
   - Include necessary context
   - Specify acceptance criteria

2. **Code Reviews**
   - Follow review checklist
   - Document review findings
   - Track technical debt
   - Ensure documentation updates

3. **AI Behavior Rules**
   - Never assume missing context
   - Ask questions when uncertain
   - Never hallucinate libraries
   - Confirm file paths before use
   - Never delete code without explicit instruction
   - **When adding new imports, always use `uv add package-name` first**
   - **Never suggest `pip install` - always suggest `uv add`**
   - **Verify imported packages exist in `pyproject.toml` before using them**

Remember to update these rules as project standards evolve.
