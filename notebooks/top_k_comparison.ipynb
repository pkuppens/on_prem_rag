For this purpose, one\\noften needs to construct specific benchmarks tailored for the\\ntarget domains or applications. Then, these domain-specific\\nbenchmarks can be combined with general benchmarks to\\nconduct both comprehensive and targeted evaluation for\\nspecialized LLMs. For example, MultiMedQA [354] is a\\nspecific benchmark in healthcare, which includes medical\\nexaminations and healthcare questions.

In addition, it would\\nalso raise privacy concerns to upload the health information\\nof patients [765] into a commercial server that support the\\nLLM.\\nEducation is also an important application domain where\\nLLMs potentially exert significant influence. Existing work\\nhas found that LLMs can achieve student-level performance\\non standardized tests [46] in a variety of subjects of math-\\nematics ( e.g., physics, computer science) on both multiple-\\nchoice and free-response problems. In addition, empirical\\nstudies have shown that LLMs can serve as writing or read-\\ning assistant for education [901, 902]. A recent study [902]\\nreveals that ChatGPT is capable of generating logically\\nconsistent answers across disciplines, balancing both depth\\nand breadth. Another quantitative analysis [901] shows that\\nstudents utilizing ChatGPT (either keeping or refining the\\nresults from LLMs as their own answers) perform better\\nthan average students in some courses from the computer\\nsecurity field.
