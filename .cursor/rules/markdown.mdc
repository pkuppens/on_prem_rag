# Cursor Rules for Markdown Files

## General Markdown Formatting

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for nested lists, 4 spaces for code blocks)
- Ensure empty lines around all major sections
- Use proper heading hierarchy (no skipping levels)
- Limit line length to 100 characters where possible

## Code Block Formatting

### Standard Code Blocks

- Always surround code blocks with empty lines
- Use proper language identifiers for syntax highlighting
- Indent nested code blocks by 4 additional spaces within lists

### Nested Code Blocks in Lists

```markdown
- Item description:
  
    ```language
    code here
    ```
    
- Next item
```

### Mermaid Diagrams
- Always surround mermaid diagrams with empty lines
- Indent mermaid diagrams properly when nested in lists
- Use descriptive node names

```markdown
- Diagram description:
  
    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A[Start] --> B[Process]
        B --> C[End]
    ```
    
- Next section
```

## File Structure Rules

- Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `user-guide.md`)
- Organize files in logical directory structures
- Include README.md files in subdirectories for navigation

## Documentation Standards

- Start each file with a clear H1 title
- Include a brief description/introduction
- Use tables for structured data
- Include references and links where appropriate
- End files with relevant next steps or related documentation

## Task Documentation Format

For task-level documentation, include:
- Context from parent goal
- Clear problem statement
- Technology considerations and trade-offs
- Implementation hints with code samples
- Definition of done checklist

Example structure:
```markdown
# Task Name

## Context
Brief context from parent goal...

## Problem Statement
What needs to be solved...

## Technology Considerations
### Option 1: Technology A
- Pros: ...
- Cons: ...

### Option 2: Technology B
- Pros: ...
- Cons: ...

### Decision: Chosen Technology
Rationale for choice...

## Implementation Hints

    ```python
    # Pseudo-code example
    def example_function():
        pass
    ```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3
