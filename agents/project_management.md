# Project Management

The project follows SAFe practices. Key expectations:

- Track work in `project/` using epics, features, stories and tasks.
- Maintain clear acceptance criteria and update status regularly.
- Reference parent work items to preserve traceability.
- Use sprint demo templates from `project/team/demos/templates/`.
