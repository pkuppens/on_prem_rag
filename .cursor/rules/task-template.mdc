# Task Template Guide

This guide defines the standard format for task documentation files (TASK-\*.md) in the project.

## File Location

Task files should be stored in `docs/project/team/tasks/` with the naming pattern `TASK-XXX.md` where XXX is a sequential number.

## Template Structure

````markdown
# TASK-XXX: [Task Title]

## Story Reference

- **Story**: STORY-XXX (Story Title)
- **Epic**: EPIC-XXX (Epic Title)

## Task Description

[Clear and concise description of the task. Use bullet points for complex requirements.]

## MoSCoW Classification

**Priority**: [Must Have | Should Have | Could Have | Won't Have]

**Rationale**: [1-2 paragraphs explaining why this task has this priority level. Consider:
- Direct contribution to project goals
- Dependencies and blockers
- Business value and urgency
- Available workarounds or alternatives]

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. [High-level requirement 1]

- [ ] **Sub-criteria 1.1**: [Specific requirement to meet criterion 1]
- [ ] **Sub-criteria 1.2**: [Specific requirement to meet criterion 1]
- [ ] **Sub-criteria 1.3**: [Specific requirement to meet criterion 1]

### 2. [High-level requirement 2]

- [ ] **Sub-criteria 2.1**: [Specific requirement to meet criterion 2]
- [ ] **Sub-criteria 2.2**: [Specific requirement to meet criterion 2]

## Technical Requirements

### Input Data

[Specify input data sources, formats, and requirements]

### Output Format

[Specify expected output format with examples]

### Processing Rules

[Define business logic and processing rules]

## Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions

- **Script Location**: [Recommended file path based on project architecture]
- **Data Model Impact**: [Required changes to existing data models]
- **Integration Points**: [How this task integrates with existing systems]

### Tool and Dependency Specifications

- **Tool Versions**: [Specific version requirements for tools/libraries]
- **Configuration**: [Where and how to configure tools]
- **Documentation**: [What and where to document]

### Example Implementation

```python
# Example code or configuration snippets
```
````

## Dependencies

- **Blocked by**: [TASK-XXX or None]
- **Blocks**: [TASK-XXX or None]

## Definition of Done

- [ ] [Specific completion criteria 1]
- [ ] [Specific completion criteria 2]

## Estimated Effort

- **Component 1**: X hours
- **Component 2**: Y hours
- **Total**: Z hours

## Related Files

- [Link to related documentation]
- [Link to related code files]

## Code Files

- [Link to implementation files with descriptions]

```

## Three-Level Hierarchy Requirements

### 1. Acceptance Criteria (Requirements)
- **Purpose**: Define what needs to be accomplished at a high level
- **Format**: Use numbered sections (### 1. [Requirement])
- **Content**: Business objectives and functional requirements
- **Example**: "Use ruff for code linting"

### 2. Sub-Criteria (Sub-Requirements)
- **Purpose**: Break down each acceptance criterion into specific, measurable requirements
- **Format**: Use bullet points with **Sub-criteria X.Y**: labels
- **Content**: Specific requirements that must be met to satisfy the parent criterion
- **Example**:
  - **Sub-criteria 1.1**: Decide on a unique version
  - **Sub-criteria 1.2**: Configure it according to best practices
  - **Sub-criteria 1.3**: Document the usage

### 3. Implementation Details (Choices)
- **Purpose**: Provide recommended implementation choices, configurations, and examples
- **Format**: Use structured sections with specific subsections
- **Content**: Version numbers, file locations, configuration examples, documentation requirements
- **Example**:
  - **Tool Versions**: ruff>=0.1.0
  - **Configuration**: pyproject.toml with permissive line length (132)
  - **Documentation**: Add to docs/SETUP.md with examples

## Required Detail Level

### Architecture Considerations
Every task must include:
- **Script Location**: Recommended file path based on project architecture
- **Data Model Impact**: Required changes to existing data models
- **Integration Points**: How this task integrates with existing systems

### Tool Specifications
Every task using tools must specify:
- **Version Numbers**: Specific version requirements (e.g., ruff>=0.1.0)
- **Configuration Location**: Where to configure the tool
- **Documentation Requirements**: What and where to document

### Cross-Referencing
- Link acceptance criteria to implementation details
- Reference related tasks and dependencies
- Include code file links with descriptions

## Guidelines
1. Use clear, action-oriented task titles
2. Keep descriptions concise but complete
3. Break down complex tasks into three-level hierarchy
4. Make acceptance criteria specific and measurable
5. Ensure sub-criteria are detailed enough for implementation
6. Provide concrete implementation choices in implementation details
7. Update the "Updated" date when making changes
8. Use checkboxes (- [ ]) for tracking progress
9. Include relevant code examples or commands in implementation details
10. Link related stories and tasks using markdown links
11. Allow trailing double spaces after each line in lists for proper rendering
12. Mark incomplete criteria if they don't meet new standards

## Example
See [TASK-006.md](mdc:docs/project/team/tasks/TASK-006.md) for a complete example.
