```

## Code Implementation Standards

### Function Design Compliance

All functions must follow [function-definitions.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/function-definitions.mdc):

```python
def example_function(
    param1: str,
    param2: int,
    optional_param: bool = False,
) -> dict[str, any]:
    """Brief one-line summary of function purpose.

    More detailed description of what the function does, including
    any important context or business logic.

    Args:
        param1 (str): Description of first parameter
        param2 (int): Description of second parameter
        optional_param (bool, optional): Description of optional parameter.
            Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        dict[str, any]: Description of return value structure

    Raises:
        ValueError: When invalid parameters are provided
        RuntimeError: When operation fails

    Example:
        >>> result = example_function("test", 42, True)
        >>> print(result["status"])
        "success"
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass

## Retrospective Feedback

### Learning and Improvement

When tasks cannot be completed on the first try, document lessons learned:

```bash
# Create retrospective note (concatenate to allow multiple entries)
echo "STORY-XXX Software Developer Retrospective:
- Issue: [What went wrong or was unclear]
- Root Cause: [Why it happened]
- Solution: [What worked or should be done differently]
- Recommendation: [Specific improvement for own or other roles]
- Date: $(date)" >> tmp/retrospectives/software-developer-retrospectives.md
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Implementation Complexity**: Break down complex features into smaller, testable components
- **Testing Challenges**: Write tests first (TDD) to clarify requirements
- **Integration Issues**: Better upfront analysis of dependencies and interfaces
- **Code Quality**: Regular refactoring and code review to maintain quality

## Handover Messages

### For Next Role (Software Tester)

```
"STORY-XXX implementation is complete. Test coverage is [X]%, integration points tested,
and demo requirements met. Please review implementation and begin comprehensive testing."
```

### For User Review

```
"STORY-XXX implementation completed. All features implemented, tests written,
and code quality standards met. Ready for Software Tester handover.
Please review implementation and approve testing handover."
```

This rule ensures Software Developers can effectively implement features, maintain code quality, and hand over completed implementations to Software Testers with proper git-based documentation and testing throughout the development process.
