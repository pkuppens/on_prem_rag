## Code Implementation Standards

### Function Design Compliance

All functions must follow [function-definitions.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/function-definitions.mdc):

```python
def example_function(
    param1: str,
    param2: int,
    optional_param: bool = False,
) -> dict[str, any]:
    """Brief one-line summary of function purpose.

    More detailed description of what the function does, including
    any important context or business logic.

    Args:
        param1 (str): Description of first parameter
        param2 (int): Description of second parameter
        optional_param (bool, optional): Description of optional parameter.
            Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        dict[str, any]: Description of return value structure

    Raises:
        ValueError: When invalid parameters are provided
        RuntimeError: When operation fails

    Example:
        >>> result = example_function("test", 42, True)
        >>> print(result["status"])
        "success"
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

git commit -m "STORY-XXX: Software Developer: code quality review - [improvements]"
```

## Testing Implementation

### Unit Testing Standards

All tests must follow [test-documentation.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/test-documentation.mdc):

```python
def test_example_functionality(self):
    """As a user I want [business objective], so I can [user benefit].
    Technical: [specific technical requirement or validation approach].
    Validation: [how the test validates the requirement - optional for complex tests].
    """
    # Test implementation
    pass
```

### Test Implementation Process

```bash
# Write comprehensive unit tests
# Test edge cases and error conditions
# Ensure test coverage >80%
# Mock external dependencies

# Commit test implementation
git add tests/test_STORY-XXX.py
git commit -m "STORY-XXX: Software Developer: add comprehensive unit tests"

# Run coverage analysis
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html tests/
git add htmlcov/
git commit -m "STORY-XXX: Software Developer: test coverage analysis"
```

### Integration Testing

```bash
# Implement integration tests
# Test system interactions
# Validate data flow
# Test error handling

# Commit integration tests
git add tests/test_STORY-XXX_integration.py
git commit -m "STORY-XXX: Software Developer: add integration tests"
```

## Documentation and Comments

### Code Documentation Standards

- **Function Docstrings**: Comprehensive documentation for all public functions
- **Class Documentation**: Clear class purpose and usage
- **Module Documentation**: Module-level documentation and examples
- **Inline Comments**: Comments for complex logic and business rules

### Documentation Updates

```bash
# Update code documentation
# Add usage examples
# Document API changes
# Update technical documentation

git add src/rag_pipeline/STORY-XXX.py
git add docs/technical/STORY-XXX-implementation.md
git commit -m "STORY-XXX: Software Developer: update documentation"
```

## Performance and Optimization

### Performance Monitoring

```bash
# Profile code performance
# Identify bottlenecks
# Optimize critical paths
# Document performance characteristics

# Commit performance improvements
git add src/rag_pipeline/STORY-XXX.py
git commit -m "STORY-XXX: Software Developer: performance optimization - [details]"

# Commit performance tests
git add tests/test_STORY-XXX_performance.py
git commit -m "STORY-XXX: Software Developer: add performance tests"
```

### Memory and Resource Management

```bash
# Optimize memory usage
# Manage resource cleanup
# Implement efficient algorithms
# Monitor resource consumption

git add src/rag_pipeline/STORY-XXX.py
git commit -m "STORY-XXX: Software Developer: resource optimization"
```

## Security Implementation

### Security Best Practices

- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication
- **Authorization**: Enforce access controls
- **Data Protection**: Protect sensitive data

### Security Implementation

```bash
# Implement security controls
# Add security tests
# Document security considerations
# Follow security best practices

git add src/rag_pipeline/security/STORY-XXX.py
git add tests/test_STORY-XXX_security.py

# Note: Changes are staged for review. Use "commit and continue" to commit and proceed.
```

## Commit and Continue Workflow

### Staging vs Committing

All role changes are staged for review rather than committed directly:

```bash
# Stage changes for review
git add src/rag_pipeline/STORY-XXX.py
git add tests/test_STORY-XXX.py
git add docs/technical/STORY-XXX-implementation.md
git add project/team/tasks/TASK-XXX-*.md
git add project/team/stories/STORY-XXX.md

# Note: Changes are staged for review. Use "commit and continue" to commit and proceed.
```

### Commit and Continue Command

When the user says "commit and continue", execute:

```bash
# Create commit message file for review
echo "STORY-XXX: Software Developer: [description of changes]" > tmp/commit_msg.txt

# Create continuation context file
echo "Next Steps:
1. [Specific next action]
2. [Dependencies to check]
3. [Handover requirements]
4. [Timeline considerations]" > tmp/continuation.txt

# Commit staged changes using message file
git commit -F tmp/commit_msg.txt

# Continue with next steps in the workflow
```

This allows the user to review both the commit message and continuation context before proceeding.

## Code Quality Standards

# Create retrospective note (concatenate to allow multiple entries)
echo "STORY-XXX Software Developer Retrospective:
- Issue: [What went wrong or was unclear]
- Root Cause: [Why it happened]
- Solution: [What worked or should be done differently]
- Recommendation: [Specific improvement for own or other roles]
- Date: $(date)" >> tmp/retrospectives/software-developer-retrospectives.md
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Implementation Complexity**: Break down complex features into smaller, testable components
- **Testing Challenges**: Write tests first (TDD) to clarify requirements
- **Integration Issues**: Better upfront analysis of dependencies and interfaces
- **Code Quality**: Regular refactoring and code review to maintain quality

## Handover Messages

### For Next Role (Software Tester)

```
"STORY-XXX implementation is complete. Test coverage is [X]%, integration points tested,
and demo requirements met. Please review implementation and begin comprehensive testing."
```

### For User Review

```
"STORY-XXX implementation completed. All features implemented, tests written,
and code quality standards met. Ready for Software Tester handover.
Please review implementation and approve testing handover."
```

This rule ensures Software Developers can effectively implement features, maintain code quality, and hand over completed implementations to Software Testers with proper git-based documentation and testing throughout the development process.
