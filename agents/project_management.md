# SAFe Project Management Rules

This file captures our approach to project planning and tracking under the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe).

- Project documents live under `docs/project/` with subdirectories for portfolio, program, and team levels.
- Epics break down into features, which break down into stories and tasks.
- Use the templates in `docs/project/*` when creating new items.
- Keep task status and progress up to date.
