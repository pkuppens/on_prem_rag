# Documentation Style

Follow these guidelines to keep code and documentation synchronized.

- Technical docs live in `docs/technical/`.
- Include a `## Code Files` section listing related source files.
- Add module docstrings referencing the docs using relative paths.
- Keep README files up to date when features change.
