# Coding Style

These guidelines summarise the coding standards enforced by the project.

- Use `uv add` to manage dependencies; never use `pip install` directly.
- Python files follow ruff linting rules with a line length of 132.
- Keep files under 500 lines. Split modules when necessary.
- Include links to relevant documentation in module docstrings.
