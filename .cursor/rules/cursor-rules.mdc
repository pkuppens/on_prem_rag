# Creating Cursor Rules

This guide explains how to create and use Cursor rules to help AI understand your codebase better.

## Rule File Basics

- Rules are stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory
- Each rule file must have a `.mdc` extension
- Rules use Markdown format with special Cursor extensions
- Rules help AI navigate and understand your codebase

## File References

To reference files in your rules, use this format:
```
[filename.ext](mdc:filename.ext)
```

The path should be relative to your workspace root.

## Rule Structure

1. Start with a clear title using a level 1 heading (#)
2. Add sections using level 2 headings (##)
3. Use bullet points for lists
4. Include code examples in triple backticks
5. Reference files using the format above

## Example Rule

```markdown
# Project Structure Guide

The main entry point is [index.js](mdc:index.js), which loads configuration from [config.js](mdc:config.js).

## Key Components

- `src/` - Contains source code
- `tests/` - Contains test files
- `docs/` - Contains documentation

## Important Files

- [package.json](mdc:package.json) - Project dependencies
- [README.md](mdc:README.md) - Project documentation
```

## Best Practices

1. Keep rules focused and specific
2. Use clear, descriptive titles
3. Include relevant file references
4. Add examples when helpful
5. Update rules when project structure changes

## Common Use Cases

- Document project structure
- Explain coding standards
- Define naming conventions
- Describe build processes
- List important files and their purposes
