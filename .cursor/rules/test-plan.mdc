# Test Plan Documentation Standards

## Overview

Test plan files (`TEST-PLAN-*.md`) define integration and acceptance tests for significant work items including STORY, FEAT, DEMO, or EPIC level components. These plans ensure comprehensive validation of functionality before release.

## File Location

- **Path**: `project/team/tests/TEST-PLAN-*.md`
- **Naming Convention**: `TEST-PLAN-XXX.md` where XXX is a sequential number
- **References**: Link to specific work items being tested

## Test Plan Structure

### Header Section
```markdown
# Test Plan: [Descriptive Title]

**ID**: TEST-PLAN-XXX  
**Work Items**: [STORY-001](../stories/STORY-001.md), [FEAT-001](../../program/features/FEAT-001.md)  
**Test Type**: Integration | Acceptance | End-to-End  
**Team**: [Testing Team]  
**Status**: Draft | Ready | In Progress | Completed  
**Priority**: P1 | P2 | P3  
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Test Lead**: [Name]  
**Reviewers**: [Names]
```

### Introduction Section
- **Test Goal**: Clear statement of what functionality is being validated
- **Scope**: What is included and excluded from testing
- **Work Items Under Test**: Direct references to STORY, FEAT, DEMO, or EPIC items
- **Success Criteria**: High-level criteria for test plan completion

### Test Environment Setup
- **Prerequisites**: Required software, access, or configuration
- **Environment Creation**: Step-by-step setup instructions
- **Fresh Environment Requirements**: When to use new git clone, virtual environment, etc.
- **Data Preparation**: Test data requirements and setup
- **Cleanup Instructions**: How to reset environment between test runs

### Test Cases Section
Organize test cases by:
- **Work Item Grouping**: Group tests by STORY, FEAT, or functional component
- **Test Case Structure**:
  ```markdown
  #### Test Case TC-XXX: [Test Case Name]
  **Work Item**: [STORY-001](../stories/STORY-001.md)  
  **Objective**: What this test validates  
  **Preconditions**: Required setup or state  
  **Execution Steps**:
  1. Step-by-step instructions
  2. Include expected results at each step
  3. Specify verification points
  
  **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Specific, measurable criteria (checked by human)
  - [ ] Observable outcomes
  - [ ] Performance or quality gates
  
  **Cleanup**: Steps to reset environment if needed
  ```

## Critical Requirements

### Human Validation
- **IMPORTANT**: Test case checkboxes MUST be manually verified by human testers
- AI agents will NOT check off test case completion boxes
- Include clear acceptance criteria that humans can objectively verify
- Each test case must have explicit verification steps

### SAFe Alignment
- Follow existing documentation patterns from [STORY-*.md](mdc:project/team/stories/)
- Reference work items using relative paths
- Maintain traceability to business objectives
- Include appropriate stakeholder reviews

### Quality Standards
- Test cases must be reproducible by different team members
- Include both positive and negative test scenarios
- Cover edge cases and error conditions
- Document expected vs actual results format

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-Test Planning
1. Review linked work items for completeness
2. Verify all dependencies are documented in Definition of Done
3. Confirm test environment matches target deployment

### Test Execution
1. Execute test cases in documented order
2. Record actual results alongside expected results
3. Document any deviations or issues discovered
4. Update work item status based on test results

### Post-Test Activities
1. Update test plan status and completion dates
2. Document lessons learned and improvements
3. Archive test artifacts and evidence
4. Update related documentation with test insights

## Example References

- Test plans should reference stories like [STORY-001](mdc:project/team/stories/STORY-001.md)
- Link to task documentation in [../tasks/](mdc:project/team/tasks/)
- Reference architecture decisions in [ARCHITECTURE.md](mdc:ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Follow patterns established in existing story documentation

Remember: Test plans validate that implemented functionality meets business requirements and technical specifications as defined in the linked work items.
