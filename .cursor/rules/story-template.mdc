3.  **Acceptance Criteria**: Write clear, testable, and specific acceptance criteria using the "Given-When-Then" format where appropriate.
4.  **Tasks**: Link to specific task files (`TASK-XXX.md`) required to complete the story.
5.  **Definition of Done**: Clearly define what conditions must be met for the story to be considered complete.
6.  **Updates**: Always update the "Updated" date when making changes to the story.
7.  **Links**: Use relative markdown links for features and tasks.
8.  **Markdown**: Ensure proper markdown formatting for readability.
