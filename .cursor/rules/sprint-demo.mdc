# Sprint Demo Documentation Standards

This rule applies to all sprint demo documentation in the [docs/project/team/demos](mdc:docs/project/team/demos) directory and its subdirectories.

## Structure Requirements

Sprint demo documents must follow a consistent structure to ensure clear communication and efficient preparation. Each demo document should be named following the pattern: `sprint-{number}-demo.md`.

### Required Sections

1. **Demo Information**
   - Sprint number and date
   - Duration (typically 30-45 minutes)
   - Target audience
   - Demo owner/presenter

2. **Story Coverage**
   - List of demonstrated stories with IDs
   - Link to related features from Program Board
   - Current implementation status

3. **Technical Scope**
   - Architecture components involved
   - New implementations or changes
   - Integration points
   - Performance considerations

4. **Demo Flow**
   - Detailed step-by-step demonstration plan
   - Time allocation for each section
   - Prerequisites and setup requirements
   - Expected outcomes and success criteria

5. **Known Limitations & Next Steps**
   - Current constraints
   - Planned improvements
   - Dependencies and risks

## Documentation Guidelines

1. **Timing**
   - Create demo document at sprint start
   - Update incrementally during sprint
   - Finalize 24h before demo

2. **Content Quality**
   - Use clear, concise language (B2 level English)
   - Include technical terms when necessary
   - Provide context for non-technical audience
   - Document all prerequisites

3. **Links and References**
   - Link to relevant stories and features
   - Reference architectural decisions
   - Include test data locations
   - Add configuration examples

## Template Usage

Use the [sprint-demo.md](mdc:docs/project/team/demos/templates/sprint-demo.md) template as your starting point. The template ensures:

- Consistent structure across demos
- Complete coverage of required information
- Clear demonstration flow
- Proper preparation for Q&A

## Best Practices

1. **Preparation**
   - Test demo flow before presentation
   - Prepare fallback scenarios
   - Document known issues
   - Have test data ready

2. **Documentation**
   - Keep sections focused and concise
   - Update success criteria as needed
   - Document technical deep-dive points
   - Include relevant metrics

3. **Follow-up**
   - Document questions raised
   - Track action items
   - Update related documentation
   - Share demo recordings if applicable
