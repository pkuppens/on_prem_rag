# SCRATCH.md File Rules

This rule defines how AI agents should interact with SCRATCH.md files.

## Purpose

SCRATCH.md files are working documentation files (.gitignored) used for:
- Temporary notes and experimental ideas
- Issue investigation and analysis
- Agent collaboration and responses

## Agent Interaction Rules

### Adding Content

Agents may add inline content to SCRATCH.md files using this format:
```
{agent_name} >>> {content}
```

Where:
- `{agent_name}` is the name of the AI agent (e.g., "Claude", "Codex", "GPT-4")
- `{content}` is the agent's response, analysis, or notes

### Content Preservation

- **DO NOT** modify existing content in SCRATCH.md files
- **DO NOT** remove or alter previous agent responses
- **DO NOT** reformat existing sections
- **ONLY** add new content using the specified format

### Examples

Correct agent additions:
```
Claude >>> The issue appears to be related to model caching. Here's my analysis...

GPT-4 >>> I agree with Claude's assessment. Additionally, we should consider...

Codex >>> Based on the code review, the following changes are needed...
```

### File References

The main SCRATCH.md file is [SCRATCH.md](mdc:SCRATCH.md).

## Best Practices

1. Use clear, descriptive agent names
2. Provide detailed, actionable content
3. Build upon previous agent responses when relevant
4. Maintain chronological order of responses
5. Focus on problem-solving and solution-oriented content
