# .gitattributes
# Enforce consistent line endings for all contributors.
# This file ensures that Git handles line endings correctly across different
# operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

# Auto-detect text files and perform normalization.
# On checkout, Git will convert LF to CRLF on Windows.
# On commit, Git will convert CRLF back to LF for storage in the repo.
* text=auto

# Explicitly set line endings for specific file types to LF.
# This is best practice for cross-platform compatibility, especially for scripts.
*.sh text eol=lf

# Other files will still be "auto"
*.py text eol=auto
*.md text eol=auto
*.json text eol=auto
*.yml text eol=auto
*.yaml text eol=auto

# Mark binary files as such to prevent Git from trying to normalize them.
# This prevents corruption of images, archives, and other non-text files.
