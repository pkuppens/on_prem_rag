# Jupyter Notebook Rule

This rule applies to Jupyter Notebooks with the `.ipynb` extension.

## JSON Format
- Ensure the notebook is in a valid JSON format.
- Use tools like `nbformat` to validate and convert notebooks if necessary.

## Jupyter Notebook Conventions
- Begin with an introductory markdown cell explaining the notebook's purpose.
- Include a table of contents if the notebook is lengthy.
- Place all import statements in the first code cell.
- Ensure there is a line feed between separate import statements.
- Keep code cells small and focused on a single task or concept.
- Prefer function and class definitions in regular Python files; use the notebook for usage and demonstration.
- Use markdown cells to explain complex logic and document assumptions.

## Best Practices
- Follow Jupyter Notebook conventions for readability and maintainability.
- Use descriptive titles and headings in markdown cells.
- Document the purpose and expected output of each code cell.
- Regularly clear output cells to reduce file size and improve readability.
- Use version control to track changes and collaborate effectively.

For more information on Jupyter Notebook best practices, refer to the [Jupyter Documentation](mdc:https:/jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable).
