# Hours Registration Standards

## Purpose

This rule defines standards for creating and maintaining hours registration documentation for WBSO (Dutch tax deduction for Research and Development) compliance.

## File Structure

Hours registration files should be stored in `docs/project/` with the naming convention `HOURS_REGISTRATION.md`.

### Utility Files Directory

All utility files, processing scripts, and analysis outputs should be stored in `docs/project/hours/`:

- Git commit history files
- Processing scripts
- Analysis outputs
- Temporary data files

## Utility Commands

### Git Commit History Extraction

```bash
# Extract complete commit history with timestamps
git log --pretty=format:"%ad %at %s" --date=short --reverse --all > docs/project/hours/git_commit_history.txt

# Extract commit history by date only
git log --pretty=format:"%ad %s" --date=short --reverse --no-merges > docs/project/hours/git_commits_by_date.txt

# Extract commit history with author information
git log --pretty=format:"%ad %an %s" --date=short --reverse > docs/project/hours/git_commits_with_author.txt
```

### Processing Scripts

Create Python scripts in `docs/project/hours/` for:

- Timestamp conversion and analysis
- Work session identification
- WBSO activity categorization
- Weekly summary generation

### File Naming Convention

- `git_commit_history.txt` - Raw git log output
- `commit_analysis.txt` - Processed commit analysis
- `weekly_summary.txt` - Weekly hours summary
- `process_commits.py` - Processing script
- `wbso_activities.py` - WBSO categorization script

## Content Requirements

### Header Information

- Project name and description
- WBSO justification statement
- Reporting period (week numbers)
- Total hours per week and period

### Daily Entries Format

Each day entry should include:

- Date (YYYY-MM-DD format) (week number and day-of-week optional)
- Time ranges (HH:MM format), rounded to 5 minutes
- Research & Development task description
- WBSO-justified activities
- Hours worked

### WBSO Qualification Criteria

Activities must qualify as Research & Development:

- **Research**: Systematic investigation to acquire new knowledge
- **Development**: Application of research findings to create new or improved products/processes
- **Technical uncertainty**: Activities with unknown outcomes
- **Innovation**: Novel approaches or solutions

### Task Descriptions

Use clear, technical language that demonstrates:

- Research methodology
- Technical challenges overcome
- Innovation aspects
- Knowledge creation
- Problem-solving approaches

### Time Tracking

- Group activities by week (include week numbers)
- Use multiple entries per day for different time periods
- Include a lunch break, with variations from 15 to 35 minutes, diner breaks of 1 to 1.5 hrs when evening commits occur.
- Realistic time ranges based on commit patterns, but a commit at 11:00 could include all the work starting at e.g. 8:40.

### Documentation Standards

- Use markdown formatting
- Include commit references where relevant
- Maintain chronological order, fill gaps to morning, afternoon, and evening sessions if commits exist. E.g. 08:30-12:00 for project setup is acceptable
- Provide sufficient detail for WBSO compliance
- Link to technical documentation when applicable

## Example Entry Format

The examples are for the long format. The short format can be derived fro, the combination of date and hour-range lines.

```markdown
### Week 22 (2025-05-26 to 2025-06-01)

#### 2025-05-30

**08:30 - 12:00** - Initial project setup and architecture planning

- Research and development of on-premises RAG system architecture
- Investigation of semantic search implementation approaches
- Technical feasibility analysis for secure document processing

**12:00 - 12:30** - Lunch break

**13:30 - 17:30** - Project documentation and planning

- Development of comprehensive project plan with 6 research goals
- Creation of SAFe project management framework
- Documentation of technical requirements and constraints
```

## Processing Workflow

### Step 1: Extract Git History

```bash
git log --pretty=format:"%ad %at %s" --date=short --reverse --all > docs/project/hours/git_commit_history.txt
```

### Step 2: Process Commits

Create a Python script to:

- Convert timestamps to readable format
- Group commits by date and time
- Identify work sessions
- Generate WBSO activity descriptions

### Step 3: Generate Analysis

- Create detailed daily entries
- Calculate weekly summaries
- Validate time ranges and breaks
- Ensure WBSO compliance

### Step 4: Create Documentation

- Format entries according to standards
- Include proper breaks and realistic schedules
- Add R&D justification
- Link to technical documentation

## Compliance Notes

- All entries must demonstrate R&D activities
- Avoid routine maintenance or administrative tasks
- Focus on technical innovation and problem-solving
- Maintain detailed records for tax authority review
- Link activities to project objectives and outcomes
- Keep utility files organized in `docs/project/hours/` directory
