## Git Handover Workflow

### 1. Receiving CEO/Stakeholder Requests

When receiving requests for story prioritization or completion:

```bash
# Check if story already exists
gh issue list --search "STORY-XXX" --state all

# If story exists, review current status
cat project/team/stories/STORY-XXX.md

# If story doesn't exist, create it following story-template.mdc
```

### 2. Feature Branch Management

#### Create Feature Branch for Story

```bash
# Create feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/STORY-XXX-[short-description]

# Update story status in local file
# Change status from "Not Started" to "In Progress"
# Update priority if needed
# Set assignee to appropriate team member

# Commit with role-specific message
git add project/team/stories/STORY-XXX.md
git commit -m "STORY-XXX: Product Owner: move to In Progress - [brief reason]"

# Push feature branch
git push -u origin feature/STORY-XXX-[short-description]
```

#### Sprint Planning Integration

```bash
# Add to current sprint planning
# Update project/team/sprints/current-sprint.md
# Update project/team/demos/next-demo.md if needed

git add project/team/sprints/current-sprint.md project/team/demos/next-demo.md
git commit -m "STORY-XXX: Product Owner: add to Sprint [X] - [business justification]"
git push origin feature/STORY-XXX-[short-description]
```

```

## Story Creation and Management

```markdown
# User Story: [Descriptive Title]

**ID**: STORY-XXX
**Feature**: [FEAT-XXX: Feature Title]
**Team**: [Team Name]
**Status**: [Not Started/In Progress/Completed]
**Priority**: [P1/P2/P3]
**Points**: [Story points]
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD

## User Story

- [ ] [Additional criteria...]

## Tasks

- [ ] **[TASK-XXX](../tasks/TASK-XXX.md)**: [Task description] - [Assignee] - [Effort]

## Definition of Done

```

### Story Quality Standards

#### INVEST Criteria Validation

- **Independent**: Story can be developed independently
- **Negotiable**: Details can be discussed and refined
- **Valuable**: Delivers clear business value
- **Estimable**: Team can estimate effort required
- **Small**: Can be completed in 1-2 sprints
- **Testable**: Has clear acceptance criteria

#### Acceptance Criteria Best Practices

- Use Given-When-Then format
- Include both positive and negative scenarios
- Specify edge cases and error conditions
- Include performance requirements where relevant
- Reference existing test data or test scenarios

## GitHub Integration

### Issue Management

```bash
# Create GitHub issue from story
gh issue create --title "STORY-XXX: [Story Title]" --body-file "project/team/stories/STORY-XXX.md" --assignee @me

# Update issue status
gh issue edit [ISSUE_NUMBER] --add-label "in-progress"
gh issue edit [ISSUE_NUMBER] --add-assignee [team-member]

# Close issue when story completed (use temp file for comment)
echo "Story completed successfully. All acceptance criteria met: ✅ [list criteria]" > tmp/issue-comment.md
gh issue close [ISSUE_NUMBER] --comment-file tmp/issue-comment.md
```

### Final Pull Request Creation

```bash
# Create pull request when story is complete
gh pr create --title "STORY-XXX: [Story Title]" --body-file "project/team/stories/STORY-XXX.md" --assignee @me

# Link branch to GitHub issue
gh issue edit [ISSUE_NUMBER] --add-assignee @me
```

## Decision Framework

### Prioritization Criteria

1. **Business Value**: Direct impact on customer satisfaction or revenue
2. **Strategic Alignment**: Supports company goals and objectives
3. **Dependencies**: Blocks other high-value work
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Reduces technical or business risk
5. **Stakeholder Urgency**: External pressure or deadlines

### Story Refinement Process

1. **Initial Draft**: Create story with basic acceptance criteria
2. **Stakeholder Review**: Validate with business stakeholders
3. **Technical Review**: Collaborate with team on feasibility
4. **Final Approval**: Confirm story is ready for sprint planning

## Communication Standards

### Stakeholder Updates

- **Weekly**: Progress updates to business stakeholders
- **Sprint Reviews**: Demo results and business value delivered
- **Ad-hoc**: Escalation of blockers or scope changes

### Team Communication

- **Daily**: Participate in daily standups as needed
- **Sprint Planning**: Lead story prioritization and acceptance criteria review
- **Sprint Review**: Present business value and gather feedback

## Quality Gates

### Story Readiness Checklist

- [ ] User story follows INVEST criteria
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable and complete
- [ ] Business value is clearly documented
- [ ] Dependencies are identified and managed
- [ ] Story is appropriately sized for sprint
- [ ] Demo requirements are specified

### Handover Readiness Checklist

- [ ] All documentation updated and committed
- [ ] GitHub issues created and assigned
- [ ] Sprint planning completed
- [ ] Demo planning updated
- [ ] Stakeholder communication completed
- [ ] Handover notes created in tmp directory

## Retrospective Feedback

### Learning and Improvement

When tasks cannot be completed on the first try, document lessons learned:

```bash
# Create retrospective note (concatenate to allow multiple entries)
echo "STORY-XXX Product Owner Retrospective:
- Issue: [What went wrong or was unclear]
- Root Cause: [Why it happened]
- Solution: [What worked or should be done differently]
- Recommendation: [Specific improvement for own or other roles]
- Date: $(date)" >> tmp/retrospectives/product-owner-retrospectives.md
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Unclear Acceptance Criteria**: Write more specific, testable criteria
- **Missing Business Context**: Provide more detailed user scenarios
- **Stakeholder Misalignment**: Schedule earlier stakeholder validation
- **Scope Creep**: Define clear boundaries and change control process
