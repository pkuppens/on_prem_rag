# Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates
# Docs: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file

# Note: While this project uses 'uv' for package management, Dependabot uses 'pip' ecosystem
# because it monitors pyproject.toml and uv.lock files. Dependabot will create PRs that can be
# synced with 'uv sync' or 'uv lock --upgrade-package <package>'.
