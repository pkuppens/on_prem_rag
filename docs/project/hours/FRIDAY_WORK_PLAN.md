   - Mitigation: Focus on R&D activities, document technical challenges

### Contingency Plans

1. **If falling behind schedule**:

   - Increase to 12 hours per Friday
   - Add Saturday morning sessions (4 hours)
   - Extend into early 2026 if necessary

2. **If ahead of schedule**:
   - Continue with planned schedule for buffer
   - Focus on quality and documentation
   - Prepare for 2026 WBSO project

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Targets
