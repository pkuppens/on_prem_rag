# WBSO Form Analysis and Project Alignment

## Form Overview

The filled WBSO project form contains the following approved project details:

**Project**: WBSO-AICM-2025-01 - "AI Agent Communicatie in een data-veilige en privacy-bewuste omgeving"
**Company**: pieterkuppens.net (KvK: 54225442)
**Start Date**: 01-06-2025
**Project Type**: AI-driven communication system with privacy and data safety focus

## Key WBSO Requirements from Form

### 1. Project Structure Requirements

- **Project Number**: Maximum 25 characters
- **Project Title**: Maximum 200 characters
- **Project Description**: Clear description of what will be developed
- **Start Date**: Project start date in dd-mm-yyyy format
- **Phasing**: Up to 10 development phases with completion dates

### 2. Technical Requirements

- **Technical Challenges**: Must identify concrete technical problems to be solved
- **Technical Solutions**: Must describe specific technical approaches to solve challenges
- **Programming Languages**: Must specify languages, development environments, and tools
- **Technical Innovation**: Must demonstrate why solutions are technically new and challenging

### 3. Hours and Costs

- **Hours**: Planned hours for the application period
- **Costs**: Direct costs related to S&O work
- **Expenses**: Equipment and tools for S&O work

## Implications for Hours Registration

### Priority Activities (WBSO-Approved - AI Agent Project)

1. **AI Framework & Access Control Development**

   - AI-agent framework design and implementation
   - Role/context-based access control systems
   - Intent recognition algorithms
   - Jailbreak detection mechanisms
   - Natural language processing for authorization

2. **Privacy-Preserving Cloud Integration**

   - Data anonymization/pseudonymization algorithms
   - Safe cloud LLM integration techniques
   - Data screening and processing layers
   - Cloud-worthiness decision rules
   - AVG compliance mechanisms

3. **Privacy-Friendly Audit Logging**

   - Custom audit log structure development
   - Secure reference systems
   - Traceability without privacy leaks
   - Privacy-preserving audit mechanisms

4. **Data Integrity & Protection Systems**
   - Data classification modules (read/edit)
   - Corruption prevention mechanisms
   - Risk operation blocking systems
   - Data integrity validation

### Non-Priority Activities (Still Valid but Lower Priority)

- General bug fixes (unless related to AI/privacy/security)
- Routine documentation (unless technical/architectural)
- Administrative tasks
- Basic feature implementation (unless AI/privacy-related)
- UI/UX work (unless security/privacy interface related)

## Recommendations for Project Alignment

### 1. Focus on Technical Innovation

- Prioritize hours on activities that demonstrate technical challenges
- Document technical problems and solutions clearly
- Emphasize innovative approaches and algorithms

### 2. Document Technical Complexity

- When registering hours, note the technical complexity involved
- Link activities to specific technical challenges from the WBSO form
- Maintain clear audit trail of technical decisions

### 3. Maintain WBSO Compliance

- Ensure all registered hours relate to approved WBSO activities
- Document the technical nature of work performed
- Keep detailed records for tax authority review

### 4. Update Hour Allocation Strategy

- Prioritize WBSO-approved activities in hour allocation
- Adjust time estimates to reflect technical complexity
- Focus on activities that demonstrate R&D nature

## Next Steps

1. **✅ WBSO Form Completed**: Project WBSO-AICM-2025-01 approved
2. **Align Activities**: Map current work to AI/privacy/security categories
3. **Update Documentation**: Ensure all documentation reflects approved WBSO project
4. **Review Hour Allocation**: Adjust hour allocation to prioritize AI agent development
5. **Focus on Technical Challenges**: Emphasize the 4 main technical challenges from the form

## Notes

- The approved WBSO project focuses on AI agent communication with privacy and data safety
- Four main technical challenges identified: access control, cloud integration, audit logging, data integrity
- Activities must demonstrate technical challenges and uncertainty in AI/privacy/security domains
- Documentation should emphasize the technical nature of AI, privacy, and security work
- Hours should be allocated to activities that qualify for R&D tax deduction in the approved project scope

## Project Phases (From WBSO Form)

1. **Basis AI framework & toegangscontrole** (06-2025)
2. **Veilige cloudintegratie & dataverwerking** (07-2025)
3. **Privacyvriendelijke auditlogging** (08-2025)
4. **Data-integriteit & -bescherming** (08-2025)
5. **Systeemintegratie & API ontwikkeling** (09-2025)
6. **Testen, documentatie & afronding** (09-2025)

This analysis provides guidance for aligning the hours registration system with the approved WBSO project requirements while maintaining the flexibility to capture all relevant AI agent development work.
