**Assignee**: QA Engineer
**Status**: Todo
**Effort**: 4 hours

## Description
Implement pytest cases that exercise the `/ask` endpoint with mocked retrieval and LLM layers to verify response structure and error handling.

## MoSCoW Classification

**Priority**: Won't Have

**Rationale**: This task is part of the main RAG system development and is unrelated to the WBSO hours completion goal. The current focus is on completing the WBSO calendar with 510 hours of entries for tax deduction purposes. This task can be deferred until after the WBSO project is completed and the calendar is populated.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test successful question answer response
- [ ] Test error handling for invalid input
- [ ] Coverage >80% for API module

## Dependencies
